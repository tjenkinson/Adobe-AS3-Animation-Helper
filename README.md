AS3-Animator
============

An Adobe ActionScript3 class to help create complex animations.

Please look at the demo class and flash project to see how it works.

This class allows you to send a set of animations that should run in sequence but also allows you to send a new sequence of animations at any time which will then run after the previous sequence has finished. The animations are run by the tweener at https://code.google.com/p/tweener/ so the paramaters you send are the same that get passed to this.

You can also specify that certain points in the animation sequence should always happen if another animation sequence is triggered which will cause the future one to wait.

Please let me know if you use this and find it helpful.

Thanks to the guys over at https://code.google.com/p/tweener/ for creating the tweener which is incredibly useful.
